# User story

My personal portfolio was originally built with Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery, but for this assignment, I converted the portfolio to use components and converted to React.js.

# Technologies Used:
HTML, CSS, REACT.js, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP - files deleted so it could deploy to Heroku properly.
